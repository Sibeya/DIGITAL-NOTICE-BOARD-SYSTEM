# 📌 Digital Notice Board System (Java Swing Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Digital Notice Board System is a Java Swing–based desktop application designed to display and manage notices digitally. It provides an interactive graphical interface to replace traditional paper-based notice boards, allowing users to efficiently view, add, edit, delete, and search notices.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To eliminate manual and paper-based notice systems  
- To provide quick and easy access to announcements  
- To simplify notice management using a graphical interface  
- To improve communication within institutions  

## 🧩 System Features
- Display notices in a scrollable notice board  
- Add new notices dynamically  
- Edit existing notices  
- Delete outdated or irrelevant notices  
- Search notices using keywords  
- Customize notice board background color  
- Exit confirmation for safe logout  

## 🖥️ System Design
The system is built using **Java Swing GUI components**:
- JFrame for main window  
- JTextArea and JScrollPane for notice display  
- JButton and JOptionPane for user interactions  
- Event handling using ActionListeners  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing  
- **Libraries:** AWT, Swing Components  

## 🔐 Security
- Restricted editing through controlled actions  
- Exit confirmation to prevent accidental closure  
- Safe handling of user inputs  

## 🚀 Advantages
- User-friendly graphical interface  
- Easy notice management  
- Reduces paperwork  
- Improves accessibility of information  
- Cost-effective and efficient  

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding Java Swing and GUI design  
- Event handling in Java  
- Desktop application development  
- Practical implementation of object-oriented concepts
